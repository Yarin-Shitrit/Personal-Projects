This is a program in C that implements a "shell" under the linux operating system allowing the user to use the shell interface to perform system calls.
The "shell" will print the user's id which is working as well as the current directory in the following format: user@path>
exactly as in the regular linux terminal.

Commands to use:
ls -> Will display all the files in the current directory.
ls -l -> Same as above, will have more thorough information on each file such as permissions, size, date of last edit etc.
echo -> Output something to the screen.
man, cat, sleep and more.
UPDATE EX2:
Shell now supports pipe operator '|' !
The Shell also supports few redirection operators:
1) > 
2) <
3) >>
4) 2>
You may also use the pipe operator before redirecting it's output, although not after.
How to exit the "shell": 
You can exit the "shell" using the command "done", this will end the current "shell" and will also print some information regarding the commands that were executed in the "shell".

How to compile:
Open a terminal in the directory and use: "gcc ex1.c -o ex1"
How to run:
After compiling as guided above, type "./ex1".
