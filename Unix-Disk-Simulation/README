This program is a simulation of the unix Disk File System : 
Which is the way that the files, their names, data etc. are stored on the disk.
The program knows how to manage the data given by the user and write it correctly to the disk, the program knows 
how to assert blocks of data using the direct blocks method and also the single in-direct method.
The blocks of data are asserted by need, it means that as long as there's any free space in 
pre-asserted block, we'll use this data first before asserting any other available blocks.
This simulation is of a small Disk File System of a small computer with a single Main Directory.
The size of the disk is pre-defined to be 256 characters (And is basically a text file).
All of the files created during the program are all store in the Main Directory.
This Disk File Management is a unix-file-system, that has default values of 3 direct blocks and one block of single-in-direct.
The default settings may be altered, but the disk size will remain 256.


Available functions:
0) Exit - Close terminal and finish.
1) listAll - Print all the data of the disk, including the files and their open/closed status.
2) FsFormat - Format the disk: You will need to enter two additional values:

                                                                            B) Number of direct enrtries.
NOTICE: !! YOU MUST FORMAT THE DISK BEFORE OPERATING ON IT!!
3) CreateFile - Create a file: You will need to enter the name of the file you wish to create.
4) OpenFile - If a file is closed, you can open it with this function by entering the file name you with to open.
5) CloseFile - Close an opened file, enter the fd of the file you wish to close.
6) WriteToFile - Write to a file: You will need to enter additional data:
                                                                         A) FD of a file.
                                                                         B) String to write.
7) ReadFromFile - Read from a file: You will need to enter additional data:
                                                                           A) FD of a file.
                                                                           B) Length to read.
8) DeleteFile - Delete a file, enter the name of the file you wish to delete.
